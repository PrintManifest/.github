## How We Think

### Creator-first  
We design with the creator’s perspective in mind. Tools should feel helpful, not complicated.

### Practical design  
Interfaces should be easy to navigate and free of unnecessary friction.

### Consistency  
A predictable, uniform experience helps creators feel confident in their work.

### Quality  
Good presentation matters. We aim to support creators in showing their models in the best light.
